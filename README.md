# DOCS
So I don't forget wtf did I do to get this through.

Keymaps were copied and pasted from ThePrimeagen's init.lua. Same thing with sets. Leave me alone.

## Plugins
- Noice (ui.lua): In charge of UI. Completely replaces messages, notifications and all the other stuff. It uses notify.nvim. Contrary to what I though, notify doesn't work by itself.
- catppuccin.lua: I like caf√©.
- harpoon.lua: Blazingly fast.
- lsp.lua: Uses lsp-zero, mason, and a whole bunch of stuff to get lsp set up.
